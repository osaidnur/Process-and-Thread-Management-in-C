# Process-and-Thread-Management-in-C
This repository contains a C program that demonstrates matrix multiplication using different approaches, highlighting the impact of optimization techniques such as multiprocessing and multithreading. We will compare the performance of:

1. **Naive Matrix Multiplication**: A straightforward, single-threaded implementation.
2. **Multiprocessing**: Matrix multiplication divided across multiple processes.
3. **Multithreading (Joinable Threads)**: Parallel matrix multiplication using joinable threads.
4. **Multithreading (Detached Threads)**: Parallel matrix multiplication using detached threads.
